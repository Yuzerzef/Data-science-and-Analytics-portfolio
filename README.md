### [Customer segmentation using K-means clustering |USM project|](https://github.com/Yuzerzef/Customer-segmentation-using-K-means)

* The aim of the project was to segment customers based on their demographic features, including age, marital status, sex, education, income, etc., to identify which consumers are similar to each other so that the business could target each segment of their customers with their relevant needs at the right time. Moreover, develop relevant strategies and make informed decisions.
* As learning algorithms, K-means clustering is used with different cluster valus
* To find the optimal cluster number K, the Elbo method is used.

  ##### Language used: R
  ##### Tools used : Ggplot, Jupyter Notebook 


### [Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction | IBM DATA SCIENCE project|](https://github.com/Yuzerzef/IBM-DATA-SCIENCE)

* The goal of this project was to predict whether or not SpaceX's Falcon 9 First Stage would land based on its relevant features.
* EDA, data pre-processing, data visualization, modeling, and evaluation were performed.
* As learning algorithms, KNN, SVM, Decision tree and Logistic regression are used.
* The obtained performances for all models are summarized in below table.
 
   | Classifier | Mean accuracy |
   |----|----|
   |Logistic regression | 0.833|
   |SVM |0.833| 
   |Decision Tree Classifier |0.833|
   |KNN Classifier |0.778|


  ##### Language used: Python
  ##### Tools used : pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklear
  
  ### [Banknote prediction using Decision tree](https://github.com/Yuzerzef/Banknote-prediction-using-Decision_tree) 

* The primary objective of this project was to develop an automated learning model that can classify banknotes based on their features.
* As a learning algorithm, a decision tree is used.
* The obtained accuracy, precision, and recall are 99%, 98.5%, and 98.5%, respectively.

  ##### Language used: Python
  ##### Tools used : pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklear

### [Patient segmentation using K-means Clustering](https://github.com/Yuzerzef/Patient-segmentation-using-K-means-Clustering)

* This is a collaborative case study.
* This case study uses the dataset from Fehrman et al., "The Five Factor Model of Personality and Evaluation of Drug Consumption Risk." The dataset contains two types of features: demographic and personality measurement. 
* The project's goal was to use demographic and personality measurement features to segment patients based on their similarities.
* As learning algorithms, K-means clustering is used with different cluster valus

  ##### Language used: Python
  ##### Tools used : pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklear
  
#### Dataset
  |Demographic features     |Personality measurement features | Targets|
  |---|---|---|
  |Age | Nscore|  Cannabis	|
  |Gender |  Escore| Benzos|
  |Education|  Oscore| Amphet|
  | Country          |          score|  |
  |Ethnicity                    |        Cscore|  
  |     |    Impulsive       |     |      
  |     |  SS|       |
